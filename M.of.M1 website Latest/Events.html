        <p class=Dandeliontext style="align-content:center"><small><img class=Dandelionimage src="images/Dandelion%20img.jpg" alt="Exhibit 1 image">Dandelion is an exhibition of new paintings by artist Ed Burkes, winner of the eighth Jonathan Vickers Fine Art Award. Established by Foundation Derbyshire in 1998, with the help of a legacy from the late Jonathan Vickers, the biennial Award brings to Derbyshire a rising artist every two years to produce work on the theme ‘A Sense of Place’, inspired by the county’s people, heritage and landscape.
        Based at the University of Derby’s Banks Mill Studios, Ed has produced a body of new work for solo exhibitions at both Derby Museum and Art Gallery and the Mall Galleries in London. Ed’s work in Derbyshire has been inspired by everyday observations, hidden history and the poetics of language, and the tradition of Well Dressing is a recurring theme.From 11 September 2020 to 14 February 2021 As per opening times at Museum and Art Gallery

        In autumn 2019, Derby Museums commissioned Alison Solomon, Storyteller and Artist Documenter, to create a display in the World Collections Gallery. The commission was to work from the collection to capture, reclassify and display objects of intolerance. Alison’s first instalment, entitled The Human Programme, will open from the 29th September. This changing display will explore in Alison’s words: “how prejudice, racism and intolerance have been skilfully and insidiously woven into societies’ norms, culture and values, across the seven pillars of society: media, the arts, religion, government, family, business, and education”. The first display will focus on family and education, drawing heavily on the museum’s considerable toy collection.
        The scheduling of this display was disrupted by the pandemic. Alison continued: “During lockdown, the world changed yet again with the public and fatal arrest of black man George Perry Floyd Jr. These events ignited a new visibly cross-cultural response within the Black Lives Matters movements. The world is now a different place and this project was always due to continue, but now with renewed urgency.”                         From 29 September 2020 to 31 January 2021 As per opening times at Museum and Art Gallery</small></p>
