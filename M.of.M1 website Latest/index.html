    <h1 class=Headings>Welcome to the Museum of Making (formerly Derby Silk Mill)</h1>
        <p class=Dandeliontext><img src="images/Modern%20Silk%20Mill.jpg" alt="Photo of original silkmill"/>Widely regarded as the site of the first fully mechanised factory in the world, The Silk Mill is the southern gateway to the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site. The site is undergoing a transformational programme that explores themes of ‘making and social history’, drawn from Derby and the Derwent Valley’s unique and on-going heritage stories. These activities take place in the refurbished ground floor of the building and are directly informing the Silk Mill’s plans for the full redevelopment of the site as a Museum of Making, over the coming years.This concept has been developed by Derby Museums in collaboration with our audiences, volunteers and partner organisations. These partnerships have resulted in a shared ambition to create a Museum of Making that will foster a spirit of experimentation and create conditions for learning and wellbeing. It will shape the way Derby is understood and appreciated and the way in which people from all places are inspired to see themselves as the next generation of innovators, makers and creators.</p>

            <p class=Dandeliontext>The £16.4m redevelopment programme is financially supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund, Derby City Council and Arts Council England. However, the Museum of Making would not be possible without the ongoing investment of ideas, time, skills and resources from our generous volunteers and partner organisations over the past 4 years. Together we have texted learning programmes, produced major family events, processed artefacts, developed new skills… even built our own furniture and displays!</p>

    <h3>What makes the mill special</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The Silk Mill of John and Thomas Lombe was one of the world’s first factories.</li>
        <li>The silk throwing machines in this building were based on machines studied by John Lombe in Italy – the designs of these were copied and smuggled to England in an early example of industrial espionage.</li>
        <li>The layout of the mills, with a large number of people in two buildings doing a number of processes, was the prototype for the modern factory and was a model for the later textile mills built for Arkwright and partners 50 years later.</li>
